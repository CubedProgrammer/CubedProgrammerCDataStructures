Use define_cpcds_vector(n,t) to initialize a vector type that stores type t with extention name n, full name will be cpcds_vector_n.
Can also use cpcds_vector_define(t) to initialize a vector type that stores type t with same extention name.
## cpcds_list
File: cpcds_list.h
Use define_cpcds_list(n,t) to initialize a list type that stores type t with extention name n, full name will be cpcds_vector_n.
Can also use cpcds_list_define(t) to initialize a list type that stores type t with same extention name.
